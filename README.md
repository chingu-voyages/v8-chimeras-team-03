You can click on any artboard (there are 3 groups for different views, mobile, tablet and desktop), and there are at least 4 sub-groups for each artboard (depending on the page), for exapmle there are landing page, sign up and home page. For mobile there is one additional artboard (when the user clicks on the hamburger meny on the right side)
Inside each artboard you could click on any element and you will get css specs (margin, width, border etc..)
Also you could click on color on the right side, and the hexadecimal color code will be automaticly copied to your clipboard

## Choose project

Toggl clone https://toggl.com

## Define MVP (minimal viable product), including mockup

A simple form with text input box (to define what you are working on) and a "start" button which start the timer and changes to "stop" button. When the button is pressed, the request is sent to our backend to register the event. The server sends back the event ID. No authentication.

## Choose tech stack (and architecture of the project)

MERN stack

### \*testing tool

## Write all functions and features (maybe in a separate file like productLog.doc, and we just basically write as many things about project as we can remember)

- Pleasant UX
- Clean UI
- Handle Edge Cases
- Deployed
- Responsive

## Prioritize tasks ( in productLog.doc)

## Make general plan (What needs to be done for every week):

### Sprint 1

### Sprint 2

### Sprint 3

### Sprint 4

### Sprint 5

### Sprint 6

### Sprint 7

### Sprint 8

## Choose project management tool (Trello/Zen Hub/Git hub project board etc)

Trello

## Detailed plan for the next two weeks:

### Sprint1:

### Sprint2:

## Git strategy

- Branches
- Bug / feature / refactor / Style
- Development
- Master

- Code Merge Process
- PRs?
- Code Review?
- Who merges?
- When do we merge (like after every feature is done and tested, or at the end of each Sprint?)

## Team Workflow

- Weekly StandUp

  - Fixed day and time:

- Sprint Reviews & Planning

- Team Check-Ins

- Pair-Programming
