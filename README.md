# Our design
__Our design can be found [*here.*](https://xd.adobe.com/spec/f3dc7539-aaa3-481c-6115-56a14b98bd63-85ed/)__



You can click on any artboard (there are 3 groups for different views, mobile, tablet and desktop), and there are at least 4 sub-groups for each page, there are landing page, sign up, log in and home page. For mobile there is one additional artboard (when the user clicks on the hamburger menu on the right side)
Inside each artboard you could click on any element and you will get css specs (margin, width, border etc..)
Also you could click on color on the right side, and the hexadecimal color code will be automaticly copied to your clipboard.


## MVP Definition 

A simple form with text input box (to define what you are working on) and a "start" button which start the timer and changes to "stop" button. When the button is pressed, the request is sent to our backend to register the event. The server sends back the event ID. No authentication.
